# Individual Reflection  - Liu Yuhao(31808610)

I primarily developed the `step_display.py` module and contributed to `main_gui.py`, including the file-saving functionality. The `QRStepDisplay` class visually demonstrates the QR code generation process, enhancing user understanding in our collective project. I designed it by breaking down QR code generation into steps (e.g., finder patterns, mask application), ensuring modularity and clarity. A key challenge was a bug where the masked QR code in `step_display.py` differed from the preview in `main_gui.py` and couldn’t be scanned. I fixed this by syncing format and version bits, ensuring scannability. If revising, I’d improve mask selection consistency between modules and add better error handling for edge cases. This experience taught me the importance of aligning interdependent components in a collaborative project.
