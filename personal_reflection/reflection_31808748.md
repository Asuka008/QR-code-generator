In this project, I worked on both matrix.py and utils.py, focusing on key matrix functions and helper methods. 

In matrix.py, I created the create_matrix() function to turn raw string input into a 2D list, making sure each row has the same length and only numbers. I also made transpose_matrix() to switch rows and columns, which works even if the matrix isn’t square. 

In utils.py, I wrote is_valid_matrix() to check if the matrix dimensions are consistent, and print_matrix() to show the matrix in an easy-to-read way. I also added some functions to safely convert input and handle extra spaces so the program runs smoothly for users. 

One challenge was dealing with wrong or uneven user input—like rows that don’t match in length or contain letters instead of numbers. To fix this, I added careful checks and error handling to keep the program from crashing. Writing these functions helped me learn how to write reusable code and think more about how data moves through the program and how to handle special cases. 

Overall, this project helped me practice Python basics in a real way and showed me how to write clean, easy-to-maintain code for programs people actually use.
