In this QR code generator project, I was primarily responsible for developing the main_gui.py file and integrating various components into a cohesive graphical user interface. My key contribution was creating a user-friendly interface that seamlessly combines our custom QR code generation logic with the amzqr library's animated QR code capabilities.

The most challenging aspect I encountered was resolving compatibility issues between our custom QR matrix implementation and the amzqr library, particularly when handling GIF background options. I initially faced difficulties as the two systems used different approaches to QR code generation. I solved this by implementing conditional logic that intelligently routes the generation process through either our custom implementation or amzqr based on user selections.

If I were to revise this element, I would consider designing a more unified abstraction layer that could handle both static and animated QR codes through a single interface. This would make the code more maintainable and reduce the complexity of the conditional logic currently in place.

Through this experience, I learned the importance of designing flexible interfaces when integrating different libraries and the value of careful planning when dealing with potentially incompatible systems.
