In this project, I implemented the latter part of `matrix.py`, including key steps such as error correction code generation and interleaving, data placement, mask application, and penalty score optimization. I used the `reedsolo` library to generate error correction codes and implemented the Zigzag data placement logic to ensure compliance with QR code structural standards. Additionally, I developed the penalty scoring algorithm to automatically select the optimal mask for better scannability. 

I also contributed to `bitstream.py`, where the `append_bits` method converts various data into binary bitstreams. This method is used by functions like `make_bytes` and `make_numeric` in the `QRDataBlock` class to prepare data for further encoding into the QR matrix.

The main challenges were understanding and debugging the interleaving logic and the penalty scoring system. These aspects involve complex pattern recognition and bit-level processing. Ensuring that the module positions fully comply with the standards was also difficult.

If I were to develop these modules again, I would refactor large functions into smaller units, add detailed comments, and write unit tests to catch issues early.

Overall, my code forms the technical core of the QR code generation functionality, ensuring the correctness and usability of the final QR code.
