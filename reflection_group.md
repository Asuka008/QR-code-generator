## Collaboration Process

Since the assignment was released, we maintained daily communication via **WeChat** to update each other on progress and resolve issues. We also held daily **Tencent Meetings** to discuss project status, assign tasks, and address any challenges together. Additionally, we used our shared **GitLab repository** to track progress, manage code submissions, and collaborate in real time.

## Roles and Task Planning

We divided the work based on functional modules, with each member responsible for a specific part:

- **Liao Zichen**: Developed the **main application and GUI**, handling user input, parameter selection, and interface interactions.
- **Ding Sihan**: Worked on **QR matrix post-processing**, implementing various **data masking rules** to optimize pattern recognition.
- **Pang Yuyan**: Designed the **structural framework** of the QR code, including **positioning**, **alignment**, and **timing patterns**.
- **Ni Ruiyang**: Managed **data block segmentation** and implemented **Reed-Solomon error correction encoding** to prepare the encoded data.
- **Liu Yuhao**: Implemented a **step-by-step visualization** of the generation process using animations and explanations.

## Code Contribution Scope

Each member developed independent **Python modules** with clearly defined interfaces to ensure integration. The system was designed using a modular approach, covering:  
- **Input & Encoding**  
- **Structure Construction**  
- **Masking & Optimization**  
- **Visualization**

Interface specifications were discussed in meetings to ensure smooth integration. All code contributions were submitted via **GitLab merge requests**, followed by **peer code review** to ensure overall quality.

## Summary

All team members contributed equally (**100% effort**) and delivered functional code modules. There were **no missing or faulty submissions**. Through consistent communication, structured task division, and effective use of collaborative tools, we successfully completed a fully functional and well-organized **QR code generator** system.
